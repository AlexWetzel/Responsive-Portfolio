# Responsive-Portfolio

A version of my portfolio site that utilizes media queries.

This is a portfolio template website using HTML and CSS. The layout of the site changes based on the size of the screen. Try shrinking the width of the browser, or view it on a smartphone!

This is my current active portfolio site until I make something shinier. On the project page I have a selection of my projects that I like the most. The other projects will be featured once I polish them off.
