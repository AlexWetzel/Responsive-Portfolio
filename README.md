# Responsive-Portfolio
A version of my portfolio site that utilizes media queries.

This is a portfolio template website using HTML and CSS. The layout of the site changes based on the size of the screen. Try shrinking the width of the browser, or view it on a smartphone!

The site isn't a completely functioning portfolio yet. The project icons in the portfolio page don't link to anything. I think I would rather make a brand new portfolio site anyway.
